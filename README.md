## Notes
I struggled with the password that required the line number of the "for loop" because I was looking at the next challenge that required me to make a for loop. It was also a little confusing getting used to the syntax of JavaScript but following the example code in the documents helped out a lot. I became more comfortable with using filters and sorted data. I think for the future, it would be helpful to get password hints to know which part of the password was wrong.
